# Detectindent plugin for Micro text editor

Whenever a file is opened, the detectindent plugin tries to automatically detect its indentation style (spaces or tabs) and set the `tabstospaces` option accordingly.

TODO: implement also detecting the indentation width (if spaces are used) and setting `tabsize` accordingly.
